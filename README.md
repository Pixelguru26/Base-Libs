Base Libs
---

Base libs is a collection of the most essential libraries - vectors, lines, math, etc - for game development in Lua.
It is developed in active use, *for* active use and will be expanded and refined over time. My primary motives are usability, light weight on both storage and memory, and minimal waste of precious CPU cycles.

Please see [the wiki](wiki/README.md) for more information.
